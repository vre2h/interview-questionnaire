### Tools/libraries/frameworks from ecosystem of JavaScript

- Task runners, builders, source-to-source compilers, optimization tools.

  - Gulp
  - Grunt
  - Webpack
  - Babel

- Libraries/Frameworks
  - What kind of problems do they wanted to solve, when they created this very tool?

## React

### React as a framework

- What kind of problems does it solve?
  - For example, when we talk about ReactJs, what problems does it solve, what kind of approaches have other tools for solving such problems? For example tools like:
    - Vue
    - Angular
    - Svelte
- Virtual DOM
- Reconcilation Algorithm
- classes vs hooks
  - pros and cons
  - differences
- Custom Hooks
- HOC's
- Render-props
- Code-Splitting
- Context

### React architecture

- HOC's vs Classes vs hooks vs render-props
- Architecturing Services with hooks

### React Testing

- JEST
- UI tests
  - React-testing-library
  - Enzyme
  - Storybooks

### React Ecosystem

- CSS-in-JS vs CSS
  - Critical CSS
- UI libraries
- Server-side-rendering vs Client-side-rendering
  - Next.js
  - Gatsby.js
  - SEO
  - Performance
- i18n

### State Management

- What kind of problems do they solve? Why we need them?
  - Flux
    - Redux
  - Mobx
  - state management libs vs default react state manager

### Static Type checking

- Typescript
- Flow
- prop-types
